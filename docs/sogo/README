this is an example configuration,
Do not use it as is, you sould enable SSL at least

The important part is the database connection (change mysql user and password), and the User Source

N.B. You need to create the sogo_view with the script in this directory after sogo database and user is created

example. 

mysql -u sogousr -p sogo <  sogo_view.sql

TODO: should I move this to the migrations?
