yii-app-bootstrap-4
===========
yii-app-bootstrap-4 is a mixture of Yii 2 Basic and Advanced templates with no backend / frontend separation, but with the database-based user functionality from the advanced template. The other important note is that it is using Bootsrap 4 instead of Boostrap 3. Some additional folders ('components', 'messages') are also added.
